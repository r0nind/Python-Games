# Python-Games

A handful of basic word games built in python

All Games are designed for the sole purpose of being run in the command line

This game is posted in hopes of community collaboration.  Feel Free to add your own rooms.  It be awesome to see what could be hashed out together.  However there are certain criteria that have to be met:

#1 Player must figure out the right path or fail and end in a gruesome end.  The gruesome ends need not be graphic.  Anything too obscene will not be accepted

#2 Rooms should have thought put into them.  Use of dramatic and descriptive language is highly encouraged

#3 Each room should be built with a sense of humour.  Sophisticated or bathroom jokes, both are accepted.  Racial slurs, hateful & discriminatory jokes designed to hurt or belittle anyone will not be tolerated.  This is to be a fun project for all, not a "Haters gonna hate club."

#4 No repeats.  If a room that is similar to what you create is already here, think of another one.  Each room must be unique and distinct from one another.  The Player will traverse from one bizarre adventure to another

#5 Have fun with it.  I believe together, the community can build an awesome game that all can enjoy.
